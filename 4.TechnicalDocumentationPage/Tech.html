                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font,
                    color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and
                    other
                    decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with
                    the
                    basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
                    HTML.</p>

                <h1>Prerequisites</h1>

                <p>Before starting this module, you should have:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Basic familiarity with using computers, and using the Web passively (i.e. looking at it,
                        consuming the content.)</li>
                    <li>A basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software, and an understanding
                        of how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files.</li>
                    <li>Basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction to HTML module.</li>




                </ol>

            <section class="main-section" id="What_is_CSS?">
                <header>What is CSS?</header>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under
                    the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key
                    terms about the language.</p>

                <p>In the Introduction to HTML module we covered what HTML is, and how it is used to mark up documents.
                    These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text,
                    paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to
                    distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing is the browser's default styles —
                    very basic styles that the browser applies to HTML to make sure it will be basically readable even
                    if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.</p>

                <h1>CSS syntax</h1>

                <code>
                        h1 {
                            color: red;
                            font-size: 5em;
                        }


                    </code>
                <p>The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this
                    case we are styling level one headings (h1) <br>


                    We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take
                    the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are
                    selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property. <br>

                    Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have
                    different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have
                    the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This
                    property can take various size units as a value.</p>

                <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>

                <code>
                        h1 {
                            color: red;
                            font-size: 5em;
                        }
                        
                        p {
                            color: black;
                        }


                    </code>

            <section class="main-section" id="Getting_started_with_CSS">
                <header>Getting started with CSS</header>

                <p>In this article we will take a simple HTML document and apply CSS to it, learning some practical
                    things about the language along the way.</p>

                <h1>Adding CSS to our document</h1>

                <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want
                    it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
                    across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS
                    from the head of your document.</p>

                <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension
                    shows that this is a CSS file.</p>

                <p>To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the

                    &lt; head &gt; of the HTML document:</p>

                <code>
                        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;


                    </code>

                <p>This
                    &lt;link&gt; element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the
                    location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by
                    adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code editor add the following to your CSS file:</p>

                <code>
                        h1 {
                            color: red;
                          }
                    </code>

                <p>Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top
                    of the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied
                    some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything
                    correctly.</p>

                <h1>Styling HTML elements</h1>
                <p>By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element.
                    We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML
                    element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector p. To turn all
                    paragraphs green you would use:</p>

                <code>

                        p {
                            color: green;
                          }
                    </code>

            <section class="main-section" id="How_CSS_is_structured">
                <header>How CSS is structured</header>

                <p>Now that you are beginning to understand the purpose and use of CSS, let's examine the structure of
                    CSS.</p>
                <p>First, let's examine three methods of applying CSS to a document: with an external stylesheet, with
                    an internal stylesheet, and with inline styles.</p>
                <ul>


                    <li>
                        <h1>External stylesheet</h1>
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <p>An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common
                    and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web
                    pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we linked
                    an external stylesheet to our web page.</p>

                <ul>


                    <li>
                        <h1>Internal stylesheet</h1>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place
                    CSS inside a &lt;style&gt; element contained inside the HTML &lt;head&gt;.</p>

                <ul>


                    <li>
                        <h1>Inline style</h1>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style
                    attribute.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="How_CSS_works">
                <header>How CSS works</header>


                <p>We have learned the basics of CSS, what it is for and how to write simple stylesheets. In this lesson
                    we will take a look at how a browser takes CSS and HTML and turns that into a webpage.</p>

                <h1>How does CSS actually work?</h1>
                <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style
                    information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind
                    that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that
                    different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).</li>
                    <li>It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the
                        computer's memory. The DOM is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.</li>
                    <li>The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as
                        embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the
                        process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.</li>
                    <li>The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into
                        different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it
                        works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as
                        required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).</li>
                    <li>The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been
                        applied to it.</li>
                    <li>The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).</li>


                </ol>
